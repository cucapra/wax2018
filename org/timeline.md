WAX Organization Timeline
=========================

Here's a list of things we did for WAX 2017:

- Mid January:
    - Set up the web site.
    - Choose and invite the PC (Adrian has lists of previous PCs).
- Late January:
    - Publicity.
        - SIGPLAN mailing list.
        - SIGARCH news.
        - Everybody posts to their own social media.
        - Email previous attendees (Adrian has this list).
    - Choose and invite keynote speakers.
- Early February:
    - PC finalized; instructions distributed.
    - HotCRP set up.
- Late February: paper deadline.
- Early March (2 weeks later): notification. (We've found that a short reviewing time is fine for our volume.)
- Late March: lightning talks and discussion topics due. (These are not reviewed.)
- Early/Mid April: the workshop!
